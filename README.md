Just something

Every great start must have a humble begining. Nothing. An idea. A will. An action. 
Suddenly something comes into being. 
If you want to do something, do it well. Do not neglect your thinking in favor of action. That's foolish.
Do not neglect action in favor of thinking. That's futile.
